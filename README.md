QUICK SORT 
Implementation of the quick-sort algorithm

The program utilises recursion to recursively divide the main array into sub-arrays around the pivots and in the process the sub-arrays are sorted and hence the array.
The division does not require extra memory space as the algorithm is an inplace sorting algorithm with a space complexity of O(1);
The algorithm maintains a polynomial time comlexity of 0(nlogn) to sort the array.

For better understanding of the recursive part,use a recursive tree to show all the recursive calls.
